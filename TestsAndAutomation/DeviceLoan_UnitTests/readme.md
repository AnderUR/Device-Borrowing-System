## Tests and automation for the DBS, using selenium and java.

#### Getting started

- Create a new project in your desired java IDE, such as eclipse. 
- Import the zip project folder deviceLoan_Selenium_Java.zip into your newly created src folder. 
- Make sure to reference the provided jar file for the selenium library in your project.
- You will need the chrome driver, which is the provided chromedriver.exe file for version 74 of the Chrome browser. If you need a newer version download the chrome driver from http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 
- The main method is located in the DeviceLoan.java file. 
- To learn more, read the comments within the code carefully. 
- Fun bit, if you already have devices in a database, you might want to try loading them through this project instead of adding each of them manually.
